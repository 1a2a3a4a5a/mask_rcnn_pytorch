# Mask RCNN in PyTorch
This is a [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) implementation of [Mask RCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).
This project attempts to
1. combine [Fast Mask RCNN](https://github.com/CharlesShang/FastMaskRCNN) 
and [faster_rcnn_pytorch](https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch) (Special thanks to these awesome authors)
2. provide experimental setup for researchers to test their new models on top of this framework
3. build ROIAlign layer in pure PyTorch.

## See you in two weeks. (Hopefully, one week after Fast Mask RCNN is done)

## Progress
- [ ] Adapt ROIAlign provided in FastMaskRNN
- [ ] ROIAlign layer in pure PyTorch
- [ ] Training
- [ ] Evaluation
- [ ] COCO Data Provider
- [ ] Finishing writing this list
- [ ] Checking the checkboxes
